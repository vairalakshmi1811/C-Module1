# Data types & Operators:Engineering Admission Marks Calculator

## Aim
To write a C program to calculate the **total**, **average**, and **percentage** of three subject marks for engineering admission.

## Algorithm
1. Declare variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `total`, `average_marks`, and `percentage`.
2. Read marks `a`, `b`, and `c` from the user.
3. Calculate `total` as the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c`.
4. Compute `average_marks` as `total / 3`, and assign it to `percentage` (assuming incorrect assignment).

## Program
```
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int a, b, c, total;
    float average_marks, percentage;
    printf("Enter marks for subject 1: ");
    scanf("%d", &a);
    printf("Enter marks for subject 2: ");
    scanf("%d", &b);
    printf("Enter marks for subject 3: ");
    scanf("%d", &c);
    total = a + b + c;
    average_marks = total / 3.0;
    percentage = average_marks;
    printf("\nTotal Marks: %d\n", total);
    printf("Average Marks: %.2f\n", average_marks);
    printf("Percentage: %.2f%%\n", percentage);  // Using %% to print %

    return 0;
}
```
